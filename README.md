### Usage
Use this code in 2 phases to create a CSV report of the editable properties of your users in Entra.

### Phase 1: Report  
Run the *M365UserPropertiesReport.ps1* (or .cmd) and enter your admin credentials.  
This will output a CSV file containing your users.  
Note: Only Enabled accounts are reported.  Only members are reported (vs guests).  

### Phase 2: Edit

Make a copy of the CSV file.  Put the UserPrincipalName as the first (required) column.  
Then, for any properties you would like to update, make any changes you need.  
Delete any columns that you donâ€™t want to update.  
Start conservatively, with one or two columns to update.  
  
- If you adjust the value, the program will adjust the property in Entra  
- If you leave the value, or change it to blank, the contents will not be changed.  
- If you enter the keyword `<clear>` (without the quotes) the property will be cleared.  
  
Run the *M365UserPropertiesUpdate.ps1* (or .cmd) to make your updates.  
The program allows you to step through each user if you want to go slowly.  

### Properties  
Here are the properties (so far) that are editable by this method.  

id, UserPrincipalName, AccountEnabled, DisplayName, GivenName, Surname, mail, BusinessPhones, MobilePhone, FaxNumber , streetAddress, city, state, postalcode, country, CompanyName, OfficeLocation, JobTitle, department, CreatedDateTime, LastPasswordChangeDateTime, EmployeeType, UserType

Note: BusinessPhones is a multi-value property.  However, this code only handles one value for this property.
